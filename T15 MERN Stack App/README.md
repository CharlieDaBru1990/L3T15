Description
Welcome to the Project Manager App, a powerful and intuitive application designed to simplify project management tasks. This README provides essential information to help you understand, install, and use the app effectively.

Installation
To launch the application, follow these steps:

Client Start:

npm start
This command initiates the client side of the application and opens it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000.

Server Start:

npx nodemon server.js
Start the server side of the application using nodemon.

Usage
Client Tests
FRONTEND:
Unit and snapshot test
To run tests for the client, navigate to the client directory in your terminal and run the following command:

npm test

BACKEND:
Snapshot test
To run tests for the server, navigate to the server directory in your terminal and run the following command:

npm test

Web Stack
This application is built using the MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. JavaScript is the main language used to develop a MERN full stack application, making it easier to integrate with other frameworks for both the frontend and backend.
