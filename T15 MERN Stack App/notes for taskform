// The TaskForm component is a functional component defined using the arrow function syntax.
// It takes several props as input, including showTaskForm, setShowTaskForm, project, task, and reloadData.

// Inside the component, there are several state variables defined using the useState hook.
// These include selectedTab, email, file, and images. The selectedTab state variable is used to keep track of the active tab
// in the Tabs component. The email state variable is used to store the email of the assignee.
// The file state variable is used to store the uploaded file for attachments.
// The images state variable is used to store the list of task attachments.

// The component also uses the useSelector hook to access the user object from the Redux store.
// The useDispatch hook is used to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

// The component defines several functions, including onFinish, validateEmail, uploadImage, and deleteImage.
// These functions handle form submission, email validation, image uploading, and image deletion, respectively.

// The component renders a Modal component from Ant Design, which displays the task form. Inside the Modal,
// there is a Tabs component with two tab panes: "Task Details" and "Attachments". The "Task Details" tab pane contains
// a Form component with input fields for task name, description, and assignee. The "Attachments" tab pane
// displays the list of task attachments and provides functionality for uploading new attachments.
